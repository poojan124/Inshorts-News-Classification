Signals from the galaxy were first detected by Australia-based telescopes in 2012 and again in 2016 which helped pinpoint its location. Possible sources for such radio bursts range from neutron stars to alien spacecraft.","http://images.newsinshorts.com.edgesuite.net/app_assets/images/2017/31aug/inshorts_image_1504161997656_354.jpg?resize=400px:*","https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/News/13?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ","zh0c69dx-1"

The orbiter captured the shadow racing at 2,400 kmph, producing the US' first coast-to-coast solar eclipse in 99 years. The $500-million spacecraft launched in 2009 is currently collecting essential data for future lunar missions.","http://images.newsinshorts.com.edgesuite.net/app_assets/images/2017/31aug/inshorts_image_1504149054508_523.jpg?resize=400px:*","https://phys.org/news/2017-08-nasa-lunar-mission-captures-solar.html?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ","zh0c69dx-1"

Researchers found the eruptions accounted for about 90% of the carbon emissions back then. However, the warming caused by these emissions cannot be compared to human-caused emissions, researchers said.","http://images.newsinshorts.com.edgesuite.net/app_assets/images/2017/1sep/inshorts_image_1504250308845_887.jpg?resize=400px:*","https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/aug/30/volcanic-eruptions-triggered-global-warming-56m-years-ago-study-reveals?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ","zh0c69dx-1"

The aircraft-mounted telescopes with sensitive, visible-light and infrared cameras observed the eclipse from 50,000 feet above the ground. The eclipse also provided an opportunity to study Mercury, which is difficult to image because of its proximity to the Sun.","http://images.newsinshorts.com.edgesuite.net/app_assets/images/2017/30aug/inshorts_image_1504066568570_262.jpg?resize=400px:*","http://www.southernresearch.org/news/southern-research-technology-captures-spectacular-eclipse-imagery/?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ","zh0c69dx-1"
